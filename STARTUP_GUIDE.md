## Customizing the Startup

### Add More Default Configurations
Edit `startup_sequence.py` to:
- Add more charter rules to Section 2
- Add more background bots to Section 9
- Customize display colors
- Adjust timing/cadence

### Modify Environment Settings
Edit `master.env` or `ops/secrets.env`:
```bash
RBOT_SCAN_FAST_SECONDS=60
RBOT_SCAN_SLOW_SECONDS=300
RBOT_MIN_SIGNAL_CONFIDENCE=0.62
RBOT_MAX_NEW_TRADES_PER_CYCLE=3
```

### View Startup Code
```bash
cat startup_sequence.py    # ~350 lines, heavily commented
cat start_trading.sh       # ~50 lines, bash wrapper
```

---

## Troubleshooting Startup

### Issue: "Virtual environment not found"
```bash
./setup.sh
```
Then try again.

### Issue: "Enhanced startup sequence not available"
Means `startup_sequence.py` is missing or has errors.
Check:
```bash
python startup_sequence.py
python -m py_compile startup_sequence.py
```

### Issue: Less than 31/31 configurations verified
Means a subsystem failed to initialize. Check the error message above the startup summary for which system failed.

### Issue: Fewer than 14/14 bots active
Some background tasks couldn't start. Check individual subsystem logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/narration.jsonl
cat logs/strict_runtime_*.txt
```

## What's Different Now

**Before startup enhancement:**
- Engine just started silently
- No visibility into which systems loaded
- Hard to verify everything was ready
- No confirmation of background bots

**After startup enhancement:**
- See all 31 systems come online
- Each system displays its configuration
- Confirm 14 background bots running
- Get startup summary saved to JSON
- Full visibility into trading readiness

---

## System is Ready When You See:

```
✅ Configurations Verified:    31/31
🤖 Background Bots Running:    14/14
📍 Status:                     READY TO TRADE

🟢 RBOTZILLA PHOENIX - FULLY OPERATIONAL
```

At this point, the bot is actively:
- Scanning for signals
- Checking all compliance rules
- Managing all open positions
- Recording all decisions
- Coordinating via Hive Mind

You can start monitoring with VS Code tasks (33 built-in tasks available).

---

**That's it!** You now have full visibility into system startup with automatic confirmation of all defaults, logic, rules, and background bots. 🎉
